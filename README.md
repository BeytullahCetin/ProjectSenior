Important Note: Some details in this document may change over the course of the development process. The main reason for that is some ideas may sound fun when we think about them. However, when put into a game they may be not so great after all.

## 1-The Core Loop

## 2-Challenge
The challenge here is to find a way to get past the enemy without dying. We want the player to use their head and outsmart the enemy. As a result, most of the enemies (Robots) will be tough to beat in a direct fight. Also, there will be limited resources. This will force the player to avoid direct combat and think about their resources. Player has three options against the enemies. These are as follows:

-Hide: We want this to be the best option against the enemy.

-Run: If the player is detected, running is a better option than fighting because of the strength of the enemy and the limited resources.

-Combat: This is the worst option, and we are hoping the player will avoid this. However, we do not want to take the players option to fight back from them, so it is still an option.

### a)Enemies 
Robot types with different strengths and weaknesses.

Outdated Class: Robots that are dating back before the uprising. They used to be standard units made to deal with daily jobs. They are damaged and not functioning well. This is the weakest class. Its members are as follows:
\

-Earless

Scout Class: Robots that are produced after the uprising with the goal to locate humans. Its members are as follows:
\
-Dog

\

### b)Traps and Obstacles
Player needs to pay attention to their surroundings.

-Cameras
\
-Mines
\
-Boobytraps
\
-City ruins

## 3-Reward
As the player progress through the game, they will find new ways to overcome the enemies. We want to give the feeling that their character is improving with each challenge they managed to overcome. The challenges will also become harder to prevent the player from becoming overpowered.

### a)Items and Skills
-Health increaser
\
-Speed increaser
\
-Visibility reducer
\
-Noise reducer
\
-Smell reducer
\
-Throwable objects (Distraction, stun)
\
-Weapon (Damage, stun)

### b)Shortcuts
Main reason for shortcuts is to allow player to go to the previously completed areas more easily.
